Display the latest Tweets from your Twitter accounts inside WordPress widgets. Customize Tweet displays using your site or theme CSS.

Based upon Wickett Twitter Widget by Automattic (now part of Jetpack)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why have you re-written the Wickett Twitter Widget plugin? =

The Wickett Twitter Widget has been grandfathered by Automattic and moved into their 
mega-plugin Jetpack. I like the simplicity of the Twitter widget by do not wish to
use other Jetpack features.

I switched to using JavaScript to load tweets as the original widget could slow down
page load if Twitter's API was taking too long to respond. 

= Can multiple instances of the widget be used? =

Yes.

= Can private Twitter accounts be used? =

No. The widget does not support authenticated requests for private data.

= I see less than the requested number of Tweets displayed =

Twitter may return less than the requested number of Tweets if the requested account has a high number of @replies in its user timeline.
