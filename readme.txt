Display tweets from one or more Twitter accounts using a WordPress widget.

== Description ==

Display the latest Tweets from your Twitter accounts inside WordPress 
widgets. Customise Tweet displays using your site or theme CSS.

Tweets are loaded after the page content to ensure a delayed response from 
Twitter doesn't slow down your website.

Based upon Wickett Twitter Widget by Automattic (now part of Jetpack).


== Development on GitHub ==

Development of this plugin is taking place in a 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/peterwilsoncc/rapid-twitter-widget).

Only tagged releases will be added to the WordPress.org svn repository.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why have you re-written the Wickett Twitter Widget plugin? =

The Wickett Twitter Widget has been grandfathered by Automattic and moved 
into their mega-plugin Jetpack. I like the simplicity of the Twitter widget 
but do not wish to use other Jetpack features.

I switched to using JavaScript to load tweets as the original widget could 
slow down page load if Twitter's API was taking too long to respond. 

= Can multiple instances of the widget be used? =

Yes.

= Can private Twitter accounts be used? =

No. The widget does not support authenticated requests for private data.

= I see less than the requested number of Tweets displayed =

Twitter may return less than the requested number of Tweets if the 
requested account has a high number of @replies in its user timeline.

= What's with the strange class names like .tweet__mention and .tweet__mention--reply? = 

The widget uses the BEM naming convention for class names, which has been 
nicely [summarised by Nicolas Gallagher](https://gist.github.com/1309546).

They're a little strange at first but I find them surprisingly useful.
